With this app you can login and, according to the login status, different components with different UI are being shown.
The login form has validation implemented: if the email and password don't respect a certain criteria, then the input field change color and the login button is also disabled.
The user can also log out by clicking on the logout button on the MainHeader component.

The original code belongs to the udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux and myself I have reproduced it and added additional comments.

Interesting concepts implemented:

- login and logout
- form validation
- dynamic styles with css modules
- conditional rendering
